			<p>Let me tell you a bit more about myself! I was born in MiaoLi Taiwan, my father is from Taipei and my mother is from Miaoli. Miaoli is a small town in taiwan, but it has absolutely amazing food and relaxing vibe. However, I never live in Taiwan for long, I moved to china when I was six month old. Since then, I grew up in China, my 12 years experience in international school makes me open-minded as well as able to respect different cultural background. I consider myself quite extroverted and solar. I also have lots of different interests which you will discover as you scroll down my page!

			<p>I present to you: my greatest hobbies, which are food and workout(｡ì _ í｡). I find immense joy in my two favorite hobbies: savoring delicious food and working out. Tasting a thoughtfully prepared meal, with its symphony of flavors, is pure bliss, turning each bite into a moment of relaxation. Equally, the rhythm of a good workout brings a surge of endorphins and leaves me revitalized. Whether it's lifting weights or stretching through yoga poses, I feel grounded, focused, and at ease. These contrasting passions harmoniously balance my life, making me appreciate the simple, yet profound, pleasure they bring. Please note that videos and pictures were found online, if there is any violation to the creation, i'm so sorry, please contact me and I will delete it. Those videos and pictures were shared for the purpose of a school project, not to make profit.</p>
